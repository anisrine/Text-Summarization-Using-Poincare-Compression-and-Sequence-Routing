786,B0018DQFPC,Not one but twice came broken.,"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad.

I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!","Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!",0.144927536,0.41025641,negative

5075,B005H3BYHI,"Best tasting coconut water I've tasted, a little pricey in these bottles","As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's.

It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles.

While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out.

388247,B007RTR8UC,"Liked the conditioner, packaging needs work","First, I really liked the conditioner.  It smells nice, not too strong a scent, it makes my hair feel very soft, it is nice and thick and works into my hair easily.<br /><br />The packaging, however, needs a small adjustment.  It has one of those lids that you push one side in & the conditioner comes out the other side, and the actual lid is nice and large and easy to manipulate, unlike some of the small lids, I really liked that part.  However, with this style of lid you have to squeeze the bottle to get the conditioner out.  Which is fine, except that the plastic is a little bit thick and hard to squeeze, and once the conditioner bottle got to less than half full, it gets harder and harder to squeeze out.  There's a lot of waste.<br /><br />Also, for you guys - my husband puts a little conditioner on his whiskers in the shower to soften up the whiskers before he shaves.  He didn't like this conditioner for that use at all, he said it was too thick and didn't seem to wash out of his beard well and gooped up the razor.<br /><br />In short, fine for hair, needs easier-to-squeeze plastic for the bottle, don't use for a pre-shave treatment :-)","First, I really liked the conditioner.",0.5,0.5,positive

391954,B000CQBZPG,You Really Need to Try This Tea,"I enjoy a variety of teas from herbal to traditional to Green & White's, but generally prefer green teas.  I found the Stash brand on sale once and they had a huge selection, so I picked 5 or 6 varieties to try, including the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  I had originally planned to pass on this variety, but thought I may as well give it a try.  As the days went on I tried each of the varieties one by one and really enjoyed them.  Then finally I got to the DB Earl Grey.  I didn't have high expectations for it, but let me tell you -- I was absolutely blown away by this tea.  It is perhaps the best tasting, most full-bodied and yet elegant tea (I know that's a strange word to describe tea with) I've ever tasted.  If you like regular Earl Greys, you will LOVE this tea.  You can tell the Bergamot oil is of very high quality.  Take your time to inhale the scent of the tea bag before you even start brewing -- it's that good.  The taste cannot be compared to any other Earl Grey I've had, and I've had some very good ones.  And you can brew quite a large cup (like a double tea-cup size) with one bag.  This tea is very full-bodied, so if you like your teas weaker, don't leave it brewing for too long.

She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />""Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.""<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />""We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.""<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The ""Canidae Team"" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.

They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.

415370,B004LL983O,"Low fat, vegetarian, non-fried alternative to ramen, but a bit bland","There are 3 flavors in the annie chun ""ramen house"" lineup, and I recently tried this one, and the ""soy ginger"" flavor. The ""ramen house"" lineup includes a packet of pre-cooked noodles that are non-fried and low fat. They come soft unlike the hard brick that usually comes with ramen. There is also a liquid soup packet. This particular flavor I found to be somewhat bland. The noodles are cooked perfectly and are a good consistency. The soup is not spicy at all. If you added some tofu, vegetables, scallions, etc you can make a more filling meal out of it. I added some soy sauce and it improved the taste considerably.<br /><br />My recommendation is to go with the MUCH better (but not vegetarian) soy ginger flavor: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL7C3M"">Annie Chun's Soy Ginger, 4.9-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> It has a much richer and better taste.

Its not too sweet and doesn't have that fake artificial taste to it that so many fruit things have. I love the crunchy part with the crispy and a touch of gooey sweet from the blueberry.

The only thing I don't like about them, they ain't big enough! Something this good, you shouldn't tease me with these little bars! Put some SIZE TO THEM when you make them! If they were twice their size they would be perfect. I ate almost the whole box, all but one after I got them. It took all the will power I had to put the last one up in the cupboard for later. After the first one I just couldn't stop! When I see these on the shelf at the store I'm definitely buying them.

493304,B001ONPN7M,Less tasty than the regular version,"My wife and I love the Cheez-It White Cheddar crackers and go through a box or two each week. We have tried both the reduced fat and regular versions, and now eat only the regular version even though it has more fat for two reasons:<br /><br />  1.
