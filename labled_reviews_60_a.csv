493746,B0044CPA28,Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Cereal is delicious,"Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut is super-delicious.  The honey coating on the cornflake base has almost a caramelized flavor, and the peanut bits add extra crunch and a little extra protein.  They stay fairly crunchy in milk if you eat them reasonably quickly- in fact, they stay crunchy longer than uncoated flake cereals do, which is a good thing.<br /><br />But the reason I give this cereal just four stars instead of five is that the serving size is 3/4c, and that'll cost you 120 calories, before you even add milk.  3/4c doesn't amount to a lot of this cereal, so to feel satisfied and stay satisfied until lunch or elevensies, (whichever comes first), you'll either have to eat more than 3/4c (and figure on taking in more calories from cereal) or supplement your bowl of cereal with an egg or two, some fruit, a glass of juice, and maybe even a piece of toast.  I know all the cereal companies say to eat their product ""as part of a balanced breakfast,"" but most people I know choose a box of cereal so they can pour their breakfast in a bowl, pour on some milk, bolt the cereal, and get out the door, avoiding fiddling with the egg, fruit, juice, toast, etc.  I have to say, as much as I love the taste of this cereal, I ate the recommended 3/4c for breakfast and didn't even last the hour before I was hungry again.<br /><br />That's not to say all is lost for Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut cereal.  It's also quite delicious if you mix the recommended serving size with a serving of Greek yogurt, either plain or vanilla or sweetened with honey, and the added protein and nutrients you get from the yogurt does make you feel fuller longer than just the cereal-and-milk combo.<br /><br />So yes, this cereal is beyond great-tasting.

Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.

494350,B004OQBC8K,What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?,"I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the ""flavor burst"", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The ""flavor burst"" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.

While both methods produce excellent tasting coffee, I realized that percolator produces far more rich taste of coffee.<br />2. The flavor is rich and tasty. The vanilla flavor is not too strong to dilute a coffee taste, but it is there. The balance is well kept.<br />3. The aroma is sweet but not overpowering. So actually it is very pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this coffee to anyone. Get your favorite book, relax, and enjoy the coffee!","Get your favorite book, relax, and enjoy the coffee!",0.25,0.434782609,negative

The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or crushed. The freshness of the coffee was OK, but it was obviously not recently ground due to a lack of intense aroma. I personally am not a big fan of the vanilla flavoring that has been added to the coffee, but it was still OK in terms of flavor.
